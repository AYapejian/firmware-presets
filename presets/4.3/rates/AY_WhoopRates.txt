#$ TITLE: AY Rates (3 Rateprofiles based on Flight Mode (Aux switch))
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.3
#$ CATEGORY: RATES
#$ STATUS: EXPERIMENTAL
#$ KEYWORDS: whoop
#$ AUTHOR: Ara Yapejian

#$ PARSER: MARKED

# TODO: This is a direct copy from UAV Tech rates preset, need to update to my rates, and change the rateprofile so that 1 is Angle Rates, rate profile 2 is Horizon Rates and 3 is Acro rates
#$ DESCRIPTION: Information:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: FREESTYLE: 1000 degrees/sec for roll and pitch, 700 - for yaw. Smooth at center stick but still snappy at the edges.
#$ DESCRIPTION:
#$ DESCRIPTION: OPTIONS:
#$ DESCRIPTION: -----------
#$ DESCRIPTION: - CINEMATIC/HD: Same max rates, but adds more smoothing (Expo.) at center stick for smooth transitions when you pass over stick centers (improved "skating" HD footage).
#$ DESCRIPTION: - WHOOP: For whoop racing in Angle/Horizon Modes.  Adjust Yaw rate and also Angle/Horizon Strenght, Level Limit and Transition.  It along with adds 0.5 Throttle Expo at the 45% throttle.
